    - Review [PyCharm's documentation on applying changes from one Git branch to another](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/apply-changes-from-one-branch-to-another.html). Note, there's some information on rebasing, which we did not discuss and I do not expect you to be familiar with. In class, we discussed letting GitHub do the work of merging branches for you. This documentation and the embedded video demonstrate doing this locally. Ultimately either is fine.
